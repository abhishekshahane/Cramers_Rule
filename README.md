This is essentially a utility to solve systems of equations with three variables.
Assume your variables to be x, y and z. 

Enter your equations when prompted, putting 1 in front of variables that are assumed to have a coefficient of 1. 

Please note: This will only provide integer solutions, and will not produce solutions for systems of equations that have no solutions or infinite solutions.

Enjoy!
